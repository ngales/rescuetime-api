<a href='http://www.rescuetime.com'>RescueTime, Inc.</a> offers time tracking and productivity monitoring via effortless data collection and sophisticated
analytics.

We've published an API for people to reuse their data, to share their data, to merge their data with others, or whatever crazy inclination they may have.

Recent updates:

2009-11-17 Added support for search by project name to go with new Pace product.

The api access keys offer different levels of control-- maybe you want to selectively publish or share your data, or feed it privately into some other business intelligence tool. Or maybe you just want whacky stats. You can do whatever you want as account owner. You can even share keys with others, and let them play with your data safely.
